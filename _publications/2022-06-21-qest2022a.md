# Moment-based Invariants for Probabilistic Loops with non-polynomial assignments

Andrey Kofnov, Marcel Moosbrugger, Miroslav Stankovic, Ezio Bartocci, Efstathia Bura

We present a method to automatically approximate moment-based invariants of probabilistic programs with 
non-polynomial updates of continuous  state variables to accommodate more complex dynamics. Our approach 
leverages polynomial chaos expansion to approximate  non-linear functional updates as sums of orthogonal polynomials. 
We exploit this result to automatically estimate  state-variable moments of all orders in Prob-solvable loops with 
non-polynomial updates.  We showcase the accuracy of our estimation approach in several examples, such as the turning 
vehicle model and the Taylor rule in monetary policy.

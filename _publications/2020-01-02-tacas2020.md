## Mora - Automatic Generation of Moment-Based Invariants

We introduce Mora, an automated tool for generating invariants of probabilistic programs. Inputs to Mora are so-called Prob-solvable loops, that is probabilistic programs with polynomial assignments over random variables and parametrized distributions. Combining methods from symbolic computation and statistics, Mora computes invariant properties over higher-order moments of loop variables, expressing, for example, statistical properties, such as expected values and variances, over the value distribution of loop variables.

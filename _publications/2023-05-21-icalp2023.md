# Positivity Problems for Reversible Linear Recurrence Sequences

George Kenison, Joris Nieuwveld, Joël Ouaknine, James Worrell

  It is a longstanding open problem whether there is an algorithm to
decide the Positivity Problem for linear recurrence sequences (LRS)
over the integers, namely whether given such a sequence, all its terms
are non-negative. Decidability is known for LRS of order $5$ or less,
i.e., for those sequences in which every new term depends linearly on
the previous five (or fewer) terms. For *simple* LRS (i.e.,
those sequences whose characteristic polynomials have no repeated roots),
decidability of Positivity is known up to order $9$.

In this paper, we focus on the important subclass of
  \emph{reversible} LRS, i.e., those integer LRS $\langle u_n \rangle_{n=0}^\infty$ whose bi-infinite completion
  $\langle u_n \rangle_{n=-\infty}^\infty$ also takes exclusively
  integer values; a typical example is the classical Fibonacci
  (bi-)sequence $\langle \dots, 5, -3, 2, -1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5,  \ldots \rangle$. 
  Our main results are that Positivity is decidable
  for reversible LRS of order $11$ or less, and for simple reversible
  LRS of order $17$ or less.

# HyperPAYNT
HyperPAYNT is an extension of the [PAYNT](https://github.com/randriu/synthesis/tree/master) tool for the synthesis of probabilistic programs and (PO)MDP controllers. Additionally, it supports probabilistic hyperproperties requirements, expressed in a custom syntax based on HyperPCTL. It is available as a Docker artifact [here](https://zenodo.org/records/8116528).

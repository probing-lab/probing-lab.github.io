## Mora

 <div align="justify">Mora is an automated tool for generating invariants of probabilistic programs. Inputs to 
 Mora are so-called Prob-solvable loops that are probabilistic programs with polynomial 
 assignments over random variables and parametrized distributions. 
 Combining methods from symbolic computation and statistics, Mora computes invariant 
 properties over higher-order moments of loop variables, expressing, for example, 
 statistical properties, such as expected values and variances, over the value distribution 
 of loop variables.</div>

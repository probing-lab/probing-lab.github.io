HSCC 2022 is the 25th in a series of conferences on all aspects of hybrid systems. It is dedicated to advancing design and analysis techniques that bridge control theory and computer science, and is expanding to new domains in security and privacy and in systems biology. The conference covers the range from theoretical results to practical applications and experiences in cyber-physical systems (CPS), mixed signal circuits, robotics, infrastructure networks, and biological models.

HSCC 2022 will be part of the 15th Cyber Physical Systems and Internet-of-Things Week (CPS-IOT Week), and co-located with the International Conference on Cyber-Physical Systems (ICCPS), Information Processing in Sensor Networks (IPSN), the Real-Time and Embedded Technology and Applications Symposium (RTAS), Conference on Internet-of-Things Design and Implementation (IOTDI), and related workshops.

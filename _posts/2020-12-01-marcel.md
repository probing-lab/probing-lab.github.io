"Marcel Moosbrugger convinced the jury with his excellent presentation on “Automating 
Termination Analysis of Probabilistic Programs” which, according to the jury, “explored 
undiscovered territory in a challenging area and managed to present the complex topic in 
an illustrative way.” He, therefore, received the Distinguished Young Alumn Award endowed 
with €1,500 for his outstanding research. His diploma thesis, supervised by Laura Kovacs, 
deals with the question of deciding the termination of computer programs—one of the most 
infamous challenges in computer science."

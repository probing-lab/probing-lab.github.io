Ezio Bartocci (General Chair) and Laura Kovacs (PC Chair of CONCUR 2020) are among the main organizers of QONFEST 2020. 


"For the first time, between August 31 and September 5, 2020, Vienna is hosting QONFEST, 
a joint congress of the most important international scientific conferences and workshops 
on the topic of concurrency theory and its applications, timed systems, semantics, logics, 
and verification techniques.  The organizers of CONCUR (31st International Conference on 
Concurrency Theory), QEST (17th International Conference on Quantitative Evaluation 
of SysTems), FORMATS (18th International Conference on Formal Modeling and Analysis 
of Timed Systems) and FMICS (25th International Conference on Formal Methods for 
Industrial Critical Systems) have managed to bring together researchers and 
practitioners from industry and academia who all seek to solve the primary 
demand of the users of technology: placing a high level of trust in the operation 
of the systems â€“ whereas trust is a combination of many characteristics, 
mainly reliability, safety, security, privacy, and usability."

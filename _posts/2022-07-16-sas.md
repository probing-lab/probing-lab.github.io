# Solving Invariant Generation for Unsolvable Loops
Daneshvar Amrollahi, Ezio Bartocci, George Kenison, Laura Kovacs, Marcel Moosbrugger, Miroslav Stankovic

Automatically generating invariants, key to computer-aided analysis of probabilistic 
and deterministic programs and compiler optimisation, is a challenging open problem. 
Whilst the problem is in general undecidable, the goal is settled for restricted 
classes of loops. For the class of solvable loops, introduced by Kapur and 
Rodriguez-Carbonell in 2004, one can automatically compute invariants from 
closed-form solutions of recurrence equations that model the loop behaviour. 
In this paper we establish a technique for invariant synthesis for loops that 
are not solvable, termed unsolvable loops. Our approach automatically partitions 
the program variables and identifies the so-called defective variables that 
characterise unsolvability. We further present a novel technique that automatically 
synthesises polynomials, in the defective variables, that admit closed-form solutions 
and thus lead to polynomial loop invariants. Our implementation and experiments 
demonstrate both the feasibility and applicability of our approach to both 
deterministic and probabilistic programs.

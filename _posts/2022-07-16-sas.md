# Distribution Estimation for Probabilistic Loops

We present an algorithmic approach to estimate the value distributions of random variables of probabilistic loops 
whose statistical moments are (partially) known. Based on these moments, we apply two  statistical methods, 
Maximum Entropy and Gram-Charlier series, to estimate the distributions of the loop's random variables.
We measure the accuracy of our distribution estimation by comparing the resulting distributions using exact and estimated 
moments of the probabilistic loop, and  performing statistical tests. 
We evaluate our method on several probabilistic loops with polynomial updates over random variables drawing from 
common probability distributions, including examples  implementing financial and biological models. For this, we leverage 
symbolic approaches to compute  exact higher-order moments of loops
as well as use sampling-based techniques to estimate moments from loop executions. 
Our experimental results  provide practical evidence of the  accuracy of our method for estimating distributions of 
probabilistic loop outputs.

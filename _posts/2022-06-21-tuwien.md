# Best Software Science Paper at ETAPS 2022

At the 2022 European Joint Conferences (ESOP, FASE, FoSSaCS and TACAS) on Theory and Practice of Software (ETAPS) held in Munich (2-7 April 2022), a multi-institutional team of researchers from AIT (Dejan Nickovic), IST (Thomas A. Henzinger, Thomas Ferrere) and TU Wien (Ezio Bartocci, Ana Oliveira da Costa) has been recognized by the European Association of Software Science and Technology (EASST) with the Best Software Science Paper Award for their work “Information-flow Interfaces”. 
This paper presents the first contract-based approach to ensure information-flow properties specifying which information a software/hardware component can observe or to interfere with while interacting with another component.

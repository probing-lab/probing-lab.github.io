# Best Paper Award at QEST 2022 
Andrey Kofnov, Marcel Moosbrugger, Miroslav Stankovic, Ezio Bartocci, Efstathia Bura 

On, September 15, 2022, Andrey Kofnov (Faculty of Mathematics TU Wien), 
Marcel Moosbrugger (TU Wien Informatics), Miroslav Stankovic (TU Wien Informatics), 
Efstathia Bura (Faculty of Mathematics TU Wien) and Ezio Bartocci (TU Wien Informatics) 
were awarded the Best Paper Award at the 19th International Conference on Quantitative 
Evaluation of Systems (QEST 2022) held in Warsaw (Poland). The prize money of 1000 Euro 
offered by Springer recognizes their achievement.

In their paper “Moment-based Invariants for Probabilistic Loops with Non-polynomial 
Assignments” they combine the theory of polynomial chaos expansion with automatic 
moment-based invariant generation to analyze, as closed-form expressions, 
the statistical moments of random variables’ distributions generated by 
probabilistic programs with non-polynomial assignments. An example of such programs 
is the Taylor rule, used by central banks to set monetary policy by raising or lowering 
their target for the federal funds rate. They have also applied their method to analyze 
the probabilistic behavior of cyber-physical systems (2D Robotic Arm, Rimless Wheel Walker, 
Turning vehicle) modeled as probabilistic programs. This paper is the result of an 
intensive and productive inter-faculty and inter-disciplinary collaboration between 
TU Wien Informatics, Mathematics, and Geoinformation (Applied Statistics).

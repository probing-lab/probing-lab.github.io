"On the occasion of the graduation ceremony for physics on May 17, 2021, in TU Wien’s Kuppelsaal, 
Marcel Moosbrugger from our research unit Formal Methods in Systems Engineering was awarded the 
City of Vienna Award for outstanding diploma theses at TU Wien.

Marcel is one of our Bachelor with Honors and was now among the seven award winners for diploma 
theses in the year 2020. His diploma thesis on “Automating Termination Analysis of Probabilistic 
Programs” was recognized for its excellence.

In his thesis, he dealt with deciding termination of computer programs as one of the most 
infamous challenges in computer science and automated the termination analysis of a class 
of probabilistic programs, called Prob-solvable loops, through (super-)martingale based proof rules."

The result of his master thesis were presented ESOP 2021: the 30th European Symposium on Programming.

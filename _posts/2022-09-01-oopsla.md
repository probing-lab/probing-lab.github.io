# This is the moment for probabilistic loops
Marcel Moosbrugger, Miroslav Stankovic, Ezio Bartocci, Laura Kov√°cs

We present a novel static analysis technique to derive higher moments 
for program variables for a large class of probabilistic loops with 
potentially uncountable state spaces. Our approach is fully automatic, 
meaning it does not rely on externally provided invariants or templates. 
We employ algebraic techniques based on linear recurrences and introduce 
program transformations to simplify probabilistic programs while preserving 
their statistical properties. We develop power reduction techniques 
to further simplify the polynomial arithmetic of probabilistic programs 
and define the theory of moment-computable probabilistic loops for which 
higher moments can precisely be computed. Our work has applications towards 
recovering probability distributions of random variables and computing tail 
probabilities. The empirical evaluation of our results demonstrates the 
applicability of our work on many challenging examples.

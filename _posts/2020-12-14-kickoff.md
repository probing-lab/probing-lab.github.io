Title: Polynomial Forms for Representing and Reasoning about Uncertainties.
Authors: Sriram Sankaranarayanan, Chou Yi, Eric Goubault and Sylvie Putot.

Abstract: We will describe polynomial forms that consist of polynomials plus intervals involving noise symbols with 
known distributions in order to represent complex probability distributions of state variables of dynamical systems over time.
Using a calculus of polynomial forms, we describe how standard operations can be implemented with rigorous tracking
of uncertainties.  Furthermore, we show how various concentration inequalities can be applied over these forms to 
reason about probabilities of events and moments of key functions. Finally, we describe conditioning on polynomial
forms and show how they can be used to perform approximate Bayesian inference for dynamical systems along with numerous
applications.


Title: Towards the Automated Synthesis of Probabilistic Programs
Authors: Joost Pieter Katoen, Milan Ceska, Nils Jansen and Sebastian Junges

Abstract:
Probabilistic programs are typically rather small, but intricate to get
correct. Whereas the main control flow is often in place, completing the
bits and pieces to a full-fledged program is non-trivial. This talk
addresses program sketching: given a partial probabilistic program,
i.e., a program with "holes", fill these "holes" such that the resulting
program satisfies the specification.

I will outline two base approaches: counterexample-guided abstraction
refinement (CEGAR) and counterexample-guided inductive synthesis
(CEGIS). The CEGAR approach iteratively partitions the design space
starting from an abstraction of this space and refines this by a
light-weight analysis of verification results. The CEGIS technique
exploits critical subsystems as counterexamples to prune all programs
behaving incorrectly on that input.

We show how these techniques can be used to sketch probabilistic
programs, to synthesise randomised distributed algorithms and
controllers for POMDPs, and to select ``good'' products in software
product lines.

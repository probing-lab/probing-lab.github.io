"Laura Kovács (TU Wien) from the FORSYTE research group (Formal Methods in System Engineering) 
has received ERC Consolidator Grant 2020 from the European Research Council (ERC) for her 
project ARTIST – Automated Reasoning with Theories and Induction for Software Technology. 
Results of the project will be able to be easily integrated and used in other technologies, 
supporting end-users and developers of formal verification engines to apply saturation-based 
first order (FO) theorem proving without the need of becoming experts in FO reasoning. 
ARTIST project builds upon previous results from Laura Kovacs’s ERC projects, such as 
ERC Starting Grant and ERC Proof of Concept Grant. The methods and tools developed within 
the project will be evaluated on academic and industrial programs, in the framework of 
ongoing collaborations with verification teams at Microsoft Research, Amazon Web Services 
and Certora. The funding – up to €2 million per grant, plus in some cases an additional 
€1 million for start-up costs – is provided for up to five years and mostly covers the 
employment of researchers and other staff to consolidate the grantees’ teams."

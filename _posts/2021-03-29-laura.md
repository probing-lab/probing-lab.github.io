"Software plays a role in almost all areas of our lives - in the healthcare system, in road traffic, 
in commerce. Everywhere, software errors can also become a severe problem. Laura Kovacs works with 
her team on logical methods that reliably and precisely detect software errors. To further advance 
this research, she has now received an Amazon Research Award, endowed with €50,000."

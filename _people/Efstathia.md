I am heading the Applied Statistics Research Unit (ASTAT) in the Institute of Statistics and Mathematical Methods in Economics with the Faculty of Mathematics and Geoinformation at the Vienna University of Technology (TU Wien).
My work focuses on dimension reduction in regression and classification, high-dimensional statistics, multivariate analysis, and applications in biostatistics, econometrics and legal statistics.

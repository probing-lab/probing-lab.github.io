# George Kenison

I work as a postdoctoral researcher in automated reasoning and program analysis at Technische 
Universit√§t Wien. Before moving to Vienna, I was a research associate in infinite-state systems 
and dynamical systems at the University of Oxford. I studied for my PhD in Mathematics, working 
under the supervision of Professor Richard Sharp, at the University of Warwick. 
Research undertaken as part of my thesis established asymptotic counting results for elements 
in non-trivial conjugacy classes in free groups.

My interdisciplinary research, at the interface of pure mathematics and theoretical computer 
science, is motivated by my interests in both quantitative and qualitative orbit phenomena 
in dynamical systems. My research interests include: asymptotic properties of groups, ergodic 
theory, symbolic dynamics, and recurrence sequences.

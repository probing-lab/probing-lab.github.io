I am an Associate Professor in Computer Science, at TU Wien, and I am leading the Trustworthy Cyber-Physical Systems
(TrustCPS) Group of the Cyber-Physical System Research Division. The primary focus of my research is to develop
formal methods, computational tools and techniques that support the modeling and the automated analysis of
complex computational systems, including software systems, cyber-physical systems and biological systems.
On these topics I co-authored more than 95 referred papers published in the main international journals and
top-tier conferences of my research areas (CAV, ICCPS, TACAS, ATVA, CDC, EMSOFT, HSCC, etc.), generating more
than 2600 citations (h-index >= 30) according to Google Scholar.

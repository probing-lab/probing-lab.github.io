As a PhD student supervised by Laura Kovács and Ezio Bartocci, my mission is to bring certainty to domains which are
uncertain in nature. What sounds like a contradiction at first, reveals itself as an intriguing and highly relevant
research area. Probabilistic Programs, Machine Learning, and stochastic systems are all around us and influence
our daily lives. Using formal methods can not only make these systems safer but can further have a beneficial
feedback effect on the development of such technologies. I gained my qualifications during my Bachelor (with Honors)
and my Master’s degree in Computer Science at TU Wien. During my studies, I interned with Laurent Doyen at
ENS Paris-Saclay on Graph Games and with Roopsha Samanta at Purdue University on verification of Neural Networks.
Before I worked as a Software Engineer for five years and my love for coding has prevailed. As a result,
after pondering about theory, I enjoy seeing it run.

Contact me if you want to collaborate, do a bachelor/master thesis in the areas of probabilistic programming and
AI verification, or if you just want to chat and have coffee.

<img class="main-image" src="http://www.eziobartocci.com/img/foto_new.png"/>
 I am a full professor for formal methods in cyber-physical systems engineering
at Faculty of Informatics at TU Wien.  I am leading the Trustworthy 
 Cyber-Physical Systems (TrustCPS) Group of the Cyber-Physical System Research Unit. 
 The primary focus of my research is to develop formal methods, computational tools and 
 techniques that support the modeling and the automated analysis of complex computational 
 systems, including software systems, cyber-physical systems and biological systems. 
 On these topics I co-authored more than 100 referred papers published in the main international 
 journals and top-tier conferences of my research areas.

 I am the scientific coordinator and principal investigator of the ProgInG project.

I am a full professor in computer science at the TU Wien, leading the automated program reasoning (APRe) group of the
Formal Methods in Systems Engineering Division. I also hold a part-time professorship at the Department of
Computer Science and Engineering of the Chalmers University of Technology. My research focuses on the design and
development of new theories, technologies, and tools for program analysis, with a particular focus on automated
assertion generation, symbolic summation, computer algebra, and automated theorem proving. I am the co-developer of
the Vampire theorem prover. In 2014, I received the Wallenberg Academy Fellowship and an ERC Starting Grant.
